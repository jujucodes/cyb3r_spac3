# cyb3r_spac3

Cyb3r_spac3 is an interactive Web VR experience exploring the illusion of “space” inside our screens and 360 computer interaction. Ever since the introduction of the Lisa Macintosh and the first desktop with layered windows and floating widgets, graphical user interfaces have redefined the virtual workspace and human computer interaction. Early internet engineers like Ted Nelson envisioned fluid, dynamic workspaces incorporating the GPU’s 3D capabilities and our natural propensity to envision the screen as a “space.” With the invention of VR and incorporation of XR capabilities into the web through libraries such as A Frame, 360 virtual spaces are now browser accessible, yet 3D and 360 as part of human computer interaction is underutilized and underdeveloped. The experience begins with a command line instruction page, which explodes into interactive RGB pixels before transitioning into 3D and 360 interpretations of desktop designs. Inspired by speculative designs of 3D desktops and 360 editors, cyb3r_space looks to the possible futures of computing and interaction through a journey from the launch of the Macintosh to the future of 3D space in a 2D screen, exploring the visual metaphors tied to pixels in our screens.
